## Automated ELT Pipeline on Google Cloud
# About the Project

I developed this project to illustrate my data engineering experience, specifically by building an end-to-end ELT pipeline on Google Cloud Platform. The data pipeline extracts unclean CSVs, transforms the data in BigQuery, and provides Looker dashboards with interactive visualizations.

# How It Works

1.	Raw Data → CSV files uploaded to Google Cloud Storage.
2.	Orchestration → Apache Airflow (on Compute Engine) automates data loading and scheduling.
3.	BigQuery → Data flows through staging → transformation → reporting layers.
4.	Visualization → Looker dashboards provide insights to end users.

# What I Showed in this Project

•	Building a cloud-native ELT pipeline

•	Automating workflows with Airflow
